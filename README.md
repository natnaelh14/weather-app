GitHub Project: Weather App
GitHub Deployed Link: https://natnaelh14.github.io/weather-app/

In this project, I set out to create a weather app that provides current weather and 5 days forecast using user's input 
(city name. In order to achieve this, I used openweathermap API to retrieve the weather data and I then extracted pertinent
information by dynamically parsing the data. I used three separate APIs (Current Weather based on city, UV Index  based on
lan and lon, and 5 day forecast). FOr the 5 day for forecast, I averaged the weather data, as the information is in 3 hour
increment. I utilized moment js to add date information. I then used jquery to append the weather information to html. I used
bootstrap cards and jumbotron to build out the html. I add styling using bootstrap and vanilla CSS. Thanks
