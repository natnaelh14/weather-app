Technologies Used : HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, API, Javascript

In this project, I set out to create a weather app that provides current weather and 5 days forecast using user's input 
(city name). In order to achieve this, I used openweathermap API to retrieve the weather data and then I extracted pertinent
information by dynamically parsing the data. I used three separate APIs (Current Weather based on city, UV Index  based on
lan and lon, and 5 day forecast). For the 5 day for forecast, I averaged the weather data, as the information is in 3 hour
increments. I utilized moment js to add date information. I then used jquery to append the weather information to html. I used
bootstrap cards and jumbotron to build out the html. I add styling using bootstrap and vanilla CSS.  I appreciate any feedback.
Thanks!
